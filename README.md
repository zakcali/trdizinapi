 PHP: Turkish characters corrupts on some servers, so i need to install mbstring extension
 Python: There is also python code, and a class (library). Did not converted Turkish chars, they look good on CLI/CommandLine/Power shell in Windows. So, I don't know if Turkish chars will be corrupted on Django, Flask etc.
